IMPORTING COURSES — Detailed Guide

Courses are imported as JSON text. Three formats are supported:

1. SINGLE OBJECT:
   {"course_id": "CS101", "title": "Intro to CS", "modules": [...]}

2. JSON ARRAY:
   [{"course_id": "CS101", ...}, {"course_id": "CS102", ...}]

COURSE STRUCTURE:
A course contains modules, and each module contains lectures.
Each lecture can have: learning objectives, core terms, coding labs,
assessments, and a video recipe (scene blocks for rendering).

GENERATING COURSES:
Use the Professor AI (Generate Curriculum tab) to create course JSON from a
topic description. The professor follows the schema automatically.

The full schema reference is available in the app's schemas directory.

    "rendering": """
VIDEO RENDERING — How It Works

The render pipeline creates animated lecture videos:

1. NARRATION: Text-to-speech synthesizes the lecture narration audio first.
   This determines the total video duration.

2. VISUALS: Animated frames are generated including:
   - Gradient background with drifting particle effects
   - Typewriter-style text reveal of narration
   - Waveform visualization synced to audio
   - Progress bar showing playback position
   - Keyword tokens appearing progressively
   - Pulsing border and scan line effects

3. AUDIO MIX: Three layers are combined:
   - TTS narration (primary)
   - Ambient pad (subtle background music)
   - Binaural beats (stereo, low volume)

4. ENCODING: Final video is encoded as H.264 MP4 with AAC audio.

OUTPUT: Files are saved locally in the data directory, organized by course.

BATCH RENDERING: Use Batch Render to queue multiple lectures at once.
""",

    "binaural": """
BINAURAL BEATS — Science and Usage

Binaural beats work by playing slightly different frequencies in each ear.
Your brain perceives a third "beat" at the difference frequency.

PRESETS:
- Gamma 40Hz (200Hz base): Peak focus, associated with heightened cognition
  (Oster, 1973; associated with 40Hz peak cognition research)
- Beta 18Hz (180Hz base): Active study, promotes concentration
- Alpha 10Hz (150Hz base): Relaxed learning, supports information absorption
- Theta 6Hz (130Hz base): Creative insight, deep reflection

USAGE:
- Select a preset in Settings
- Binaural beats are automatically mixed into rendered lectures
- Use stereo headphones for the effect to work properly
- Volume is kept low to not interfere with narration

The beats include harmonics, fade envelopes, and tremolo modulation
for a natural listening experience.
